# Project

Applied learning of basic C# practices (properties and methods) and introductory OOP principles (declaring and using classes).

You can name your VirtualPet and then it takes you to the interaction console menu where your pet can either: play, Eat, Sleep, and 
use washroom. Each interaction effects the pets Happiness, Fullness, Tiredness, or hunger level.

As long as you satify your pet to maximum of 90 percentage level and make happy, the game takes you through different options to interact
with you pet untill you win the game.
